# COMMAND LINE AMAZON
<p>CL-Amazon application is a program run through command line incorporating Node.js and MySQL. The application has two different scenarios it can run.
</p><p>
The first scenario is as a customer interaction. The inventory available is loaded automatically for the convenience of the customer. Then input a choice of product to purchase and the amount they wish to buy. If there is an insufficient quantity, the customer will be alerted of that and asked if they would like to proceed. They can also go back and choose a different product if they made a choice in error or changed their mind.
</p><p>
The second scenario is as a manager interaction. It starts off with a selection of choices at the managers disposal. Viewing the entire inventory, seeing which products are low in inventory, adding additional stock to a specific product, and adding a new item entirely. The selections will keep recurring until the manager invokes the quit in the selection.
</p>
</p><p>
The third scenario is as a supervisor interaction. It starts off with a selection of choices at the supervisors disposal. Viewing the entire inventory and its current cost analysis including profits, overhead costs of departments, total sales and total profit after overhead costs are incorperated or adding a new department entirely to the store. The selections will keep recurring until the supervisor invokes the quit in the selection.
